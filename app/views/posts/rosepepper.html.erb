          It was Christmastime, so we felt the need to go to Christmas Berry. Better known as eastern Nashville's <a href="http://rosepepper.com/">Rosepepper Cantina</a>. (A Rosepper is a Mexican Christmas <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schinus_terebinthifolius">berry</a>.) Killer Margs. Dope Carnitas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chacho and nacho both had the carnitas. Reader one thing you should know, Chacho's had more Carnitas than practically anyone in Middle Tennesse. These are good.

        <h3>Nacho's Tip</h3>
        <p>I know you want to put chips into your mouth every second you're at a Mexican restaurant. If, like me, this is a problem for you, here's a tip. After you finish your first basket just break off tiny portions and dip it in the salsa. Your boca will never know you didn't eat a full chip!</p>

        <h3>Chacho's Truth</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pay attention to your corn tortillas. They are the critic's pick for the best part of the meal.</li>
          <li>Cool neon sign inside</li>
          <li>The guac is fresh and tasty, but Chacho's not trying to mess with those big ass pillowy chip thingy's in it.</li>
          <li>Your attitude is the most important part of your day.</li>

          <strong>Chips and Salsa</strong> 4.5<br>
          Nearly perfect if not for Chacho's childish reservations.

          <strong>House Margarita</strong> 4.5<br>

          <strong>What Chacho Said</strong><br>
          "<em>The chips and salsa arrive first scoring 4.5 out of five baskets of chips. The trio of salsas features delicious tomatillo salsa as well as a medium and hot traditional salsa. There were current list of restaurants a short the margaritas at Rosepepper are peerless. They are delicious.</em>"

        <p>
          <strong>What Nacho Said</strong><br>
          "<em>Steam bludgeoned my face as I removed the soft corn tortillas from their foil wrapping. (Chacho Interjecting Here: Nacho got pretty pumped about his meal arriving.) The vibe is good but the soundtrack is Brooklyn 2010 + Seven Nation Army. Which is cool if you were especially into that year. If you're really into that year then you'll have a blast in this Mexican ristorante.</em>"
