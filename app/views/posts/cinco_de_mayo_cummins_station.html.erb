        <p>The set is the streets of Bakersfield, CA. Cue the iconic "Welcome to Bakersfield" sign. Nacho rides out in the back of <a href="/mr-aguila">Mr. Aguila</a> wearing his Dwight Yoakam jeans and trademark '97 Levi's denim jacket. He launches into the riff from Yoakam's classic "<a href="http://youtu.be/gdoSLeYgkAI">Fast as You</a>." Cut to Chacho in the spotlight standing right above the "B" in Bakersfield.

        <h3>Nacho's Tip</h3>
        <p>Do not give your phone number away to any business. There are pretty much only two unique strings that data aggregation services can use to identify youâ€“your social security number and your phone number.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Congratulations to 2015 NFL Hall of Fame inductee, Mick Tinglehoff</li>
          <li>We were amazed when we discovered that Pitchfork gave <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em> a 10</li>
          <li>We call them weak, who are unable to resist the slightest chance love might exist and for that forsake it all</li>
