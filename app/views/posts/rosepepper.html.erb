          It was Christmastime, so we felt the need to go to Christmas Berry. Better known as eastern Nashville's <a href="http://rosepepper.com/">Rosepepper Cantina</a>. (A Rosepper is a Mexican Christmas <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schinus_terebinthifolius">berry</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Chacho and Nacho both had the carnitas. Reader, one thing you should know, Chacho's had more Carnitas than practically anyone in Middle Tennesse. These are good.

          <em>Update:</em> We came back for early-evening Valentine's Day margaritas. We're two straight dudes that eat a lot of meals together. Not that there's anything wrong with that!

        <h3>Nacho's Tip</h3>
        <p>I know you want to put chips into your mouth every second you're at a Mexican restaurant. Here's a tip: after you finish your first basket just break off tiny portions and dip them in the salsa. Your boca will never know you didn't eat a full chip!</p>

        <h3>Chacho's Truth</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The guac is fresh and tasty, but Chacho's not trying to mess with those big-ass, pillowy chip thingy's in it.</li>
          <li>People don't think of Cisco as being that important, but that is a huge company.</li>

          <strong>Chips and Salsa</strong><br>
          <em>4.5 out of 5 chips</em><br>
          Nearly perfect if not for Chacho's childish reservations.

          <strong>House Margarita</strong><br>

          Chacho still wants to know why they're clear.
