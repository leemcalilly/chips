        <p>It was a Sunday night and we had just finished up a session of <a href="http://gethiphopabs.com">Hip Hop Abs</a> so we headed down to Chuy's in Midtown for some Mexican food.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <p><strong>Chips and Salsa:</strong> 3<br>
          The salsa was just not very good. The chips were thin, so it had that going for them..</p>
        <p><strong>House Margarita:</strong> 3.5<br>
          Pretty good. No sweet and sour. Real lime juice.</p>
        <p><strong>&iquest; Si or No?</strong> Si.</p>

        <h3>Nacho's Tip</h3>
        <p>
          Go to the booth in the far back right if you need to charge your device. There's a half-uncovered electrical outlet on level with the seat.</p>
        </p>

        <h3>Chacho's Truth</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Guac is the standard blender guac they leave in the fridge.</li>
          <li>This place has extremely small portions of beans and rice.</li>
          <li>Nacho was ecstatic when Taylor Swift's "Shake it Off" came on the radio in the kitchen. The dining room had traditional ranchero music, which says a lot for ranchero music.</li>
          <li>The chips, menus, and tortillas are unnecessarily large.</li>
          <li>The menus have little Hunts tomato and Land O'Lakes logos on them for no apparent reason.</li>
          <li>We forgot to time it but per usual food came out really fast.</li>
          <li>They pay $21 per square foot in rent.</li>
          <li>This establishment serves Cherry Coke and milkshakes.</li>
          <li>The basket for the chips looks like they bought it at a church supply store.</li>
          <li>Don't eat at Mexican restaurants that have woks.</li>
          <li>You can't hack your life.</li>
        </ul>

          <strong>What Chacho Said</strong><br>
          "<em>Well I missed Christmas. Came down with the flu for the first time ever so I called the news to let them know what happened. They sent a camera crew down and interviewed me while I laid in bed in my hoodie I was sweating through.</em>"

          <strong>What Nacho Said</strong><br>
          "<em>That was unfortunate.</em>"
