        <p>The set is the streets of Bakersfield, CA. Cue the iconic "Welcome to Bakersfield" sign. First Nacho comes out from under the sign in the bed of <a href="/mr-aguila">Mr. Aguila</a>. Wearing his Dwight Yoakam jeans and his trademark '97 Levi's denim jacket, he launches into the riff from Yoakam's classic "Fast as You." Cut to Chacho in the spotlight standing on top of the Bakersfield sign. Chacho starts agressively air strumming his '98 Melissa Ethridge Takamine Ovation.</p>

Wearing his Dwight Yoakam jeans and his trademark '97 Levi's denim jacket, he launches into the riff from Yoakam's classic "Fast as You." Cut to Chacho in the spotlight standing right above the "B." Chacho starts agressively air strumming his <a href="http://www.ovationguitars.com/custom/usa-signature/melissa-etheridge-signature-w597-meii-white-pearl-mid-depth-cutaway-w-case/">'98 Melissa Ethridge Ovation</a>.</p>

        <p>TL;DR We end with Mr. Aguila and Nacho being pulled up to the top of the Bakersfield sign by a late model white Ford F-350 with lots of sparklers going off around the tires. He joins Chacho on top of the sign where they attempt a Garth-Brooks-Standing-Outside-the-Fire-Tour guitar smash after which Chacho falls off the Bakersfield sign into the back of the late model Ford which luckily has an air mattress in the bed. The crowd is horrified.</p>

        <h3>Nacho's Tip</h3>
        <p>Do not give your phone number away to any business. There are pretty much only two unique strings that data aggregation services can use to identify youâ€“your social security number and your phone number.</p>

        <h3>Chacho's Truth</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Congratulations to 2015 NFL Hall of Fame inductee, Mick Tinglehoff</li>
          <li>We were amazed when we discovered that Pitchfork gave <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em> a 10</li>
          <li>We call them weak, who are unable to resist the slightest chance love might exist and for that forsake it all</li>
