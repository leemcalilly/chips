        <p class="lead">Chacho and Nacho here. We're typing this from Nacho's brand new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sm-g900v-Sm-g900t-Sm-g900a-Sm-g900p-Sm-g900r4/dp/B00JLKUSAM">Samsung SM-G900V Galaxy S5</a>. We had a serious language barrier with our waiter at this place, so much so that Chacho must have ordered The Poison Bistec Ranchero instead of the regular Bistec Ranchero. While eating it he said "This is the best thing I've ever consumed," only to be consumed by a debilately stomach bug the next day. The onions were the only identifiable object from La Hacienda in his vomit.</p>
        <p>In fact he was so put out that Nacho had to bring over 3 large Gatorades and a large Sprite.</p>
        <p>Both of us agree that Citrus Cooler is by far the best Gatorade flavor. You might remember that Michael Jordan was fond of it in the 90s. It really tastes more like Oranges than the actual Orange flavor, and apparently Chacho also likes red and blue reminds him of summer days on the golf course. Nacho considered buying Fierce Melon too, but felt that was too much of a gamble. Anyhoo, La Hacienda was very good, even if Nacho did come down with the norovirus the day after we ate there.</p>

        <p><strong>Chips and Salsa:</strong> 4.5<br>
          The only reason this is not a 5 is we need to leave room for the chips and salsa at Campos on Pico in Santa Monica. Once you've had that, you know a true 5.</p>
        <p><strong>House Margarita:</strong> 3.5<br>
          Eh. Standard Ranchro juice. They used the iced tea glasses so that's a plus. Also there was real fruit in there, but it seemed to be made from a mix.</p>
        <p><strong>&iquest; Si or No?</strong> Si.</p>
